Adding coal and iron to the furnace gives you a seemingly random amount of iron bars 






SOLVED:     
Right now there is only a delay in the mining animation when the 
player is actually mining an ore. 
    - tested by an event that occured seemingly by accident. 
        - mining animation while not colliding with an ore vein...

If you hold down 'f' while over an ore and the walk away you keep mining.
